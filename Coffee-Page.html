      <h2 id="mission">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>At MugsRUs, we don’t just sell mugs—we craft experiences, tangible echoes of warmth, nostalgia, and self-expression. 
        A mug is more than just a container; it’s a ritual, a companion in early mornings and late-night conversations, a quiet witness to dreams, ambitions, and the simple pleasure of a perfect sip. 
        We believe in elevating the ordinary, in transforming everyday moments into something memorable, something uniquely yours. 
        With an obsessive dedication to design, quality, and the art of the drinking experience, we create more than just mugs—we create small, comforting pieces of life itself. 
        So go ahead, wrap your hands around one. You’re not just holding a mug; you’re holding a fucking story.</p>

        <p class="individual-review">"I never knew a mug could change my life until I ordered from MugsRUs. This isn't just a cup—it's a goddamn statement.
         My morning coffee tastes 37% better, and I swear my productivity has doubled. 11/10 would buy again." <br><strong> – Jake R.</strong> </p>
        <p class="individual-review">"I bought a mug as a gift, but when I saw it, I kept it for myself. The weight, the handle, the sheer personality—perfection. 
          Sorry, Mom, you’re getting socks for Christmas instead." <br><strong>– Lisa M. </strong></p>
        <p class="individual-review">"If I had one of these mugs earlier, I probably never would have gotten into a scandal with Monica Lewinsky" <br><strong>– Anonymous</strong> </p>
